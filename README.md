To use the same setup there are some stuff that need to be done
- install Packer 
``` sh
  git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
  ```
  - close then reopen nvim, this will trigger Packer to install the plugins. read further about [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
  - To get the icons the file exploere use a nerd font, I'm using FiraCode
